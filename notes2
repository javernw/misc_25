📌 Transcript Summary

Label: Sprint Planning Follow-up – Rule Engine Project

This was a brief, impromptu check-in call between a product stakeholder and a development team member to clarify plans and readiness for the upcoming sprint.

⸻

🧭 Purpose of the Call
	•	To confirm if the development team has enough clarity and work for the next sprint
	•	To understand what’s being planned for the next month
	•	To clarify any outstanding needs or blockers
	•	To ask about explainability requirements for upcoming event generation work

⸻

✅ Key Points Covered

1. Sprint Readiness
	•	The developer confirmed they have enough information to begin the next sprint.
	•	Work will focus on event generation from the rule engine.

2. Event Generation Goals

The upcoming sprint will aim to:
	•	Capture and generate event-level data
	•	Specifically include:
	•	Feature-level details that contributed to an alert
	•	ATL/BTL (Above/Below Threshold Limit) indicators
	•	Rule scores and the rule set thresholds that were applied

📌 Note: The goal is to create structured output for each event triggered by the rule engine, including supporting features and thresholds that led to the trigger.

3. Pending Item – Explainability
	•	There was uncertainty around explainability requirements for the events.
	•	The dev team is currently not planning to include model-level explainability unless additional guidance is given.
	•	The product stakeholder said they’ll follow up with more direction if needed.

4. Sprint Planning Logistics
	•	The upcoming sprint planning meeting is scheduled for the next day at 12 PM.
	•	The developer will:
	•	Attend the planning session
	•	Formalize the sprint stories and goals based on the current plan
	•	The stakeholder will make notes for the product lead (Aaron) to ensure alignment.

⸻

🧾 Next Steps
	•	Developer to prepare and finalize sprint stories before the planning call

📣 Detailed Summary – Rule Engine Sprint Review & Execution Framework

This transcript documents a comprehensive sprint review meeting, including a walkthrough of completed deliverables, system design, technical demos, and future planning related to the rule execution engine for financial crime detection.

⸻

✅ Sprint Achievements

1. Database Schema & ERD Design
	•	The team designed and implemented a relational database schema to support the rule engine.
	•	Key tables include:
	•	Rules Table – holds individual rule definitions
	•	Features Table – maps each rule to specific behavioral indicators
	•	Thresholds Table – stores tunable parameters for each rule
	•	Rule Sets & Segments – group rules based on customer profiles or risk categories
	•	Rule Config Table – captures configuration data (weights, thresholds, enable flags) for each segment-rule combination
	•	Feature Catalog – stores metadata about features derived from the feature engineering pipeline
	•	A working ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) was presented to show how these components interrelate.

2. Sample Rule Ingestion & Execution Setup
	•	Two sample rules were ingested from dummy datasets to simulate how real-world configurations would be stored and executed.
	•	These rules were converted into valid database entries according to the new schema, ensuring consistency between business logic and technical implementation.
	•	Threshold values, weights, and logic conditions were encoded into JSON files.

3. Execution Flow Design
	•	The team created a modular end-to-end execution pipeline, which begins with:
	•	Identifying which rule sets are active
	•	Generating configuration files (JSON) based on database values
	•	Triggering Databricks workflows that read these configs
	•	Executing logic using customer features and segmentation
	•	Outputting the results to S3 buckets
	•	Writing final outputs to Postgres for portal consumption

⸻

⚙️ Technical Implementation

Components Developed:
	•	Script to Convert DB Configs → JSON
Converts rules, segments, and thresholds into runtime configuration files to be consumed by the engine.
	•	Databricks Orchestration Script
Triggered through a workflow, this spins up clusters, runs rule logic, and shuts down resources after execution to manage costs efficiently.
	•	Execution Logic Script (PySpark)
Joins customer segmentation data with feature values, then applies rule logic using configurations from JSON files. The logic handles multiple rule types (e.g., thresholds on business-hour transactions, third-party deposits).
	•	Sample Output Generation
Outputs from two rules were generated and stored in S3. These simulate alert events and will later be ingested into the portal.

⸻

🔁 System Design Philosophy
	•	The rule engine is designed to be data- and config-driven, allowing:
	•	Easy onboarding of new rules and segments
	•	Reusability of rule logic across populations
	•	Dynamic control of thresholds, weights, and logic without code changes
	•	This makes the framework similar to vendor solutions (e.g., SAM AI) but more flexible and under full internal control.

⸻

🔮 Future Enhancements & Discussions

1. Portal Integration
	•	In future sprints, the portal will:
	•	Allow users to define segmentation logic
	•	Manage thresholds and weights via UI
	•	Auto-generate JSON configuration files
	•	Provide a history/audit log of changes

2. Segment Logic Flexibility
	•	Instead of static segment files, the team discussed enabling logic-based segment assignment. This would allow users to define rules (e.g., “customers with 3+ high-value deposits”) to dynamically assign customers to segments.

3. Bulk Rule Upload Strategy
	•	The team acknowledged the importance of batch-configuring rules and thresholds, especially if many rule sets need to be deployed at once. This could be done via file upload or automated ingestion.

⸻

💬 Sprint Reflections & Team Feedback
	•	Sprint objectives were met ahead of schedule; work on Sprint 2 (execution flow) has already begun.
	•	Team members confirmed that story sizing and allocation were appropriate, and the current velocity is sustainable.
	•	Leadership emphasized the need for a forward-looking roadmap:
	•	Clearly outline what will be delivered in the next 2–3 sprints
	•	Prepare talking points for stakeholder updates and demos

⸻

🗓️ Next Steps
	•	Continue building and refining the execution scripts
	•	Begin integration with portal once feature catalog and configuration UI are ready
	•	Define upcoming sprint themes: portal-driven rule configuration, segmentation logic input, and end-to-end alert review



Here’s a breakdown of some key questions asked during the transcript, along with the answers or responses provided:

⸻

🔍 1. What is the purpose of this system? Is it replicating a vendor solution like SAM AI?

Question:

“This system… is it trying to simulate something like SAM AI?”

Answer:

No, it’s not SAM AI. This is an abstraction layer that mimics the idea of rule execution, but with flexibility and control. Unlike SAM AI, the rules here are fully customizable by the institution and not out-of-the-box.
The rule engine is designed to complement machine learning models, catching cases that ML may miss.

⸻

🔍 2. What are the inputs to the rule engine?

Question:

“What are the inputs to this execution flow?”

Answer:

There are three main inputs:
	1.	A JSON file containing the rule configurations (logic, thresholds, weights).
	2.	The feature output data.
	3.	The segmentation output, which maps customers to risk groups.

⸻

🔍 3. Who provides the JSON configuration file? Is it manually created?

Question:

“That JSON file—is it being created manually now? Where will it come from later?”

Answer:

Yes, currently it’s manually created for testing.
In the future, it will be automatically generated by the portal, which will allow users to configure rule sets, thresholds, and weights through the UI.

⸻

🔍 4. Can segmentation logic be rule-based rather than a static file?

Question:

“Do I need to provide a static segmentation file, or can I give you logic (e.g., if a customer meets X, they go to segment Y)?”

Answer:

You can provide the logic. The segmentation component will generate an output file based on that logic. So, yes, rule-based segmentation is supported.

⸻

🔍 5. How configurable are rule sets? Can they be created in bulk?

Question:

“Can we bulk upload rule sets instead of manually configuring them one by one?”

Answer:

Yes, the system supports this.
A batch upload mechanism (via file or portal) is envisioned. The rule configuration is template-driven, so segments, rules, and thresholds can be scaled quickly using scripts or portal-driven interfaces.

⸻

🔍 6. How long does it take to configure a rule set?

Question:

“How long would it take to configure a single rule set?”

Answer:

It depends on complexity. For a simple setup (1 segment, 1 rule), it could take ~15 minutes.
For larger sets with multiple segments and threshold variants, it scales with the number of configurations.
Automation (e.g., script-generated thresholds) is expected to streamline this.

⸻

🔍 7. What’s coming in future sprints?

Question:

“What’s planned for the next 2–3 sprints?”

Answer:

While exact story breakdowns weren’t finalized, expected deliverables include:
	•	Portal UI integration for rule and segmentation configuration
	•	End-to-end demo of rule configuration to execution
	•	Enhancements to threshold logic, audit logs, and alert generation

⸻

🔍 8. Are we tracking the team’s velocity correctly? Is the sprint scope reasonable?

Question:

“Do we feel like the story allocations were appropriate for this sprint?”

Answer:

Yes, team members confirmed that the goals were achievable. In fact, they started work on the next sprint early.
There’s confidence that this velocity is sustainable for upcoming sprints.
