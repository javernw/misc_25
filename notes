### **Cleaned Notes: Financial Crime Risk Scenarios & Data Access**  

#### **Risk Scenarios & SAM8 Coverage**  
- **9 risk scenarios identified** – All covered by SAM8, but two have only partial coverage.  
- **Human Trafficking** – Need to remain cautious regarding SAM8 coverage.  

#### **Data Access & Sources**  
- **US Data Access:** Limited to **Card data**; discussions focused only on card-related features.  
- **Loan & Deposit Data:** To be confirmed (TBC).  
- **Data Source Status:**
  - **Orange** – Data source information available (e.g., Customer Table, which includes KYC data but contains PII and will be tokenized first). Need to determine the level of usage—currently under discussion.  
  - **Green** – **No access** to these data sources.  
  - **Blue** – **Already have access in AWS**.  

#### **Customer & Account Data**  
- **Customer Bureau Information:** Available only for existing customers. Updated data exists in Bs, but features have not yet been created.  
- **Customer Account Linkage:** Customers can have multiple accounts, but each account may have multiple users (e.g., primary and secondary).  
- **Account Data Includes:**
  - Credit limit  
  - Balance information  
  - Fees  
  - Available credit  

#### **Additional Data Considerations**  
- **Airline Ticket Data:** Includes departure/arrival airport details.  
- **Validation Needed:** Confirm if all airline card types are included or only certain partner-issued cards.  
- **Customer Watchlist:** **Not available**.  
- **SAM8 Alert & SAR Info:** Full access available, except within AWS.  
- **SAR Reporting Preference:** Initial SARs preferred over continuing SARs.  

#### **Credit Risk & Income Modeling**  
- **US Credit Risk Income Model:** Maintained, but data resides in Hadoop. Uncertainty about when AWS access will be granted for Quant teams.  
- **Income Estimation:**
  - If customer-provided income data is available, use the last 12 months.  
  - If unavailable, the model will generate income estimates using Customer Bureau data and save the calculated income for the customer.  

#### **Feature Engineering Considerations**  
- **Primary Data Used:**  
  - Account and Transaction data  
  - Customer, Airline Ticket, Authorization, and Application data (newly accessed; team needs time to explore before building features).  
- **Account Features:**
  - **Credit limit utilization**  
  - **Transaction patterns**:
    - Average, Max, and Sum of transactions per month  
    - Trends over **Last 30, 60 days, 6 months**, etc.  
    - Total credit usage over **N days**  
  - **Transaction Amount Considerations:**  
    - Transactions ending in whole dollar amounts vs. amounts like **$X.95** (possible indicator of gift card purchases).  
    - Gift card purchases may be identified via merchant information.  
- **Non-Domestic Transactions:**  
  - Transactions occurring in **high-risk countries**.  
- **Payment Behavior & Source Tracking:**  
  - **Self vs. Third-Party Payments:** Cannot determine if a customer is paying or if someone else is making the payment on their behalf.  
  - **Available Insights:**  
    - Can identify the **bank name** but **not the owner** of the payment source.  
    - Payee details are available.  
  - **Missing Bank Name:**  
    - Payment may not be coming directly from a bank.  
    - May originate from alternative sources (e.g., **cash payments via third-party services**).  
  - **Smurfing vs. Structuring:**  
    - **Smurfing** – Involves multiple people.  
    - **Structuring** – Involves a single person breaking transactions into smaller amounts.  

#### **Fraud & Bust-Out Patterns**  
- **Bust-Out Fraud Indicators:**  
  - Patterns of **bad payments** over time.  
  - Customers making multiple payments that repeatedly fail before the account is closed.  
- **Identifying Self vs. Third-Party Transfers:**  
  - Cannot determine if a customer is sending funds to their own account (e.g., PayPal) or to someone else.  
  - Merchant details available but may not indicate recipient identity.  
  - **Potential Solution:** KYC data—if accounts are tied to a nickname/alias, this might provide additional insights.  



**Subject:** Clarification on Identifying Payment Source Ownership  

Hi [Recipient’s Name],  

I hope you're doing well.  

I’m looking for clarification on how we can determine the ownership of a payment source. Currently, we can identify the **bank name** associated with a payment, but we are unable to distinguish **who owns the account** that made the payment. Specifically, we cannot determine:  

- Whether the payment was made by the customer themselves or by a third party on their behalf.  
- The exact owner of the payment source (i.e., account holder details).  
- If there are any patterns or indicators we can use to infer ownership.  

However, we are able to see **who the payee is** in the transaction.  

Would you be able to provide any insights on:  
1. **Whether there are existing data points or methods** we could use to infer payment ownership?  
2. **Any additional data sources** that might contain relevant information on the account holder?  
3. **Possible flags or indicators** that could help differentiate between self-payments and third-party payments?  

Appreciate any guidance you can provide. Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best,
